# WORDLE GAME
A simple GUI game that let you guess a 5 letter country with maximum 6 attempts.

##Description
The game picks randomly one country with 5 letters. You are then asked for your input and after you click Play the letters will be rendered with different colors based on your guess.
	- green: you guessed the correct letter in the correct position
	- yellow: you guessed the correct letter in the wrong positions
	- grey: letter is not correct
	
If you enter the correct country then the letters will be all green and you can start a new game by clicking Play again/Skip country.

You can click Play again/Skip country also when you want a new country to be randomly picked.

##Testing
You need to have Python installed on your computer and an IDE to open the project folder. I recommend using PyCharm.

After Python and PyCharm are installed on your machine you can open the project and make sure a valid interpreter is used when running the script.

Run main.py and play the game.

###Notes
Python version used: 3.10
The correct letter is printed in the terminal for testing purposes.
